Malanjhkudum Waterfall is located around 10 kilometers from Kanker city; the road was good enough. I visited there along with my friends on the occasion of Dec. 31st. We reached there in the afternoon; the weather was mild. The place was not overcrowded like other waterfalls. 

We were asked not to take selfies, but we couldn't resist seeing the beauty of the place. The hill requires you to climb countless stairs to reach the top; you may feel tired upon climbing numbers of stairs, but it is worth it. The water of the waterfall comes from the hill itself; water was super clean there. This waterfall is the origin of the Dudh river, which flows through Kanker city. Malanjhkudum is the name of a small village near the waterfall. The view from the hill was excellent; the forest is very dense; many other mountains are visible from there. The flow of the water from the slope is rapid.  The hill rocks are slippery because of the continues flow of water, so be careful.  A tourist died a few months ago while taking selfies near the waterfall. 

This place is a perfect picknick spot. Over the years, it has become a top-rated holiday destination. However, you may want to keep some snakes with you as there is no shop nearby.

The stunning view from the hill will convince you to visit again. We clicked many photos there and lingered there for 4 hours and then headed for Kanker as we were starving.
