It's just a coincidence that birthday of mine and my brother's falls on same day, however my brother is 2 years older than me. My family always celebrated our birthdays together cutting same cake, so I usually had a joint birthday with my brother. My parents were really good about it and always made us feel special on our birthday, they have always been supportive to us.



Thanks for all the wishes!!
