Malanjhkudum Waterfall is located around 10 kilometers from Kanker city; the road was good enough. I visited there along with my friends on the occasion of Dec. 31st. We reached there in the afternoon; the weather was mild. 

We were asked not to take selfies, but we couldn't resist seeing the beauty of the place. The hill requires you to climb many stairs to reach the top; you may feel tired upon climbing hundreds of stairs, but it is worth it. The water of the waterfall comes from the hill itself, water was super clean there.
