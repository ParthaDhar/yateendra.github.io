Bilaspur streets are shrouded in a heavy gray haze of dust, ash and other pollutants, and residents complained of breathlessness, watering of eyes, aggravated coughs and wheezing.

The condition of road is very disappointing and it will become worse in rainy season, morever the trees are being cut down. No control on dust due ongoing construction. People deserve clean air, clean water. Government officials need to address this issues. Bilaspur needs good governance.
